# SVD-based-rec-system-music-artists
This project allowed me to study how singular value decomposition (SVD) can be used in recommendation systems to make predictions about users. Using Last FM dataset, I created a recommender system that uses SVD to predict what music artists a user might like and return a list with top recommendations for that user.
