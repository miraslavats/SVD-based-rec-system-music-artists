# SVD-based-rec-system-music-artists
In my previous project I gathered movie information via webscraping andcreated a simple metadata-based system (it was solely based on the genre, description, title, stars, and directors of the movie). The "system" was very simple and did not take into account any user information whatsoever, which made me curious about recommendation systems in general. As I was researching, I came across model-based recommendation systems which tend to be very accurate, and I decided to explore one of them. This project allowed me to study how singular value decomposition (SVD) can be used in recommendation systems to make predictions about users. Using Last FM dataset, I created a recommender system that uses SVD to predict what music artists a user might like and return a list with top recommendations for that user.
